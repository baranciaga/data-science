In this repository two approaches to Collaborative Filtering are implemented, one based on kNN the other based on matrix factorization realized with neural networks and the keras API.
## Data Sets
The data sets used in the algorithm are:
1. MovieLens
https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html
2. Amazon product reviews
https://www.kaggle.com/saurav9786/amazon-product-reviews
Since the datasets are too large for the repository we urge you to download them and store them in a proper directory. 
## Features

* kNN based Collaborative Filtering
* Neural Networks based Collaborative Filtering
* Web Application
	* Data visualization
	* Selection of data sets and parameters
* Evaluation of accuracy
* List of recommendations based on CF algorithm 

## UI 
We've also built a minimalistic frontend using streamlit.
